<img src="./stuff/Earthaxis1.jpg" alt="Earth's tilt" width="600" height="400">
<p>Earth revolves around the sun, so, when the north pole is facing more towards the sun, the northern hemisphere will get more sunlight than the southern hemisphere. Because of this, the northern hemisphere will be summer, and the southern hemisphere will get winter. If the south is facing more towards the sun, the southern hemisphere will get summer, while the northern hemisphere will get winter.</p>
